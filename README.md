# FinalAssignment_LondonCrimes
In this project, I explored the different boroughs in London and the total crimes in the areas. Such information is always useful for people looking to relocate to London. We always tend to see the safer areas to raise our family. Further I explored the neighbourhoods in the safest borough and cluster the neighbourhoods using K-means clustering. I have used the data from https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/recorded_crime_summary, and scraped the geographical co-ordinates of the London Boroughs from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_London_boroughs using Beautiful soup. I used Foursquare API to get the most common venues of the safest borough of London.
